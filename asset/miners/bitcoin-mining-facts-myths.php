                                Bitcoin mining only accounts for 0.1-0.2% of the world's energy consumption.

                                Mining is the most efficient, cleanest industrial user of electricity, and is improving
                                its energy efficiency at the fastest rate of any other major industry. No other industry
                                comes close (consider planes, trains, automobiles, healthcare, banking, construction,
                                precious metals, etc.)

                                The Bitcoin network continues to become more energy efficient because of the relentless
                                improvement in the semiconductors (SHA-256 ASICs) that power the bitcoin mining centers.
                                When combined with the halving of bitcoin mining rewards every four years that is built
                                into the protocol, this results in a consistent 18-36% improvement year after year in
                                energy efficiency.

                                Actually, conservative estimates on Bitcoin emissions are a fraction of a percent. The
                                majority of mining is powered by excess renewable energy and subject to a curtailment
                                program, whereby they only utilize otherwise unwanted load on the grid and make that
                                load available in times of peak demand. The drive to excess renewables and curtailment
                                programs are a primary target of Bitcoin miners and their market share is growing. A
                                number of companies are also using flared gas, where Bitcoin mining is functioning as an
                                economic incentive to reduce emissions without a public subsidy. Large public companies
                                are ramping up efforts which will result in real, measurable and meaningful reduction in
                                emissions.

                                Bitcoin miners are largely location agnostic and are free to seek the most
                                cost-effective sources of energy globally. This guides mining companies to turn to
                                remote renewable sources that sustainably produce power disconnected from public demand.
                                This underutilization of the energy is necessary in order for power to be cost
                                competitive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A majority of miners' hashrate is powered by sustainable energy with many real world
                                examples relying on sustainable sources entirely. Metrics show almost 60% of energy for
                                Bitcoin mining comes from sustainable sources. As the cost of natural gas increases, and
                                the relative cost of green energy lowers, more and more mining companies are
                                incentivized to make the switch to sustainable energy sources such as hydropower, solar
                                power, and nuclear energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many bitcoin mining companies, like Bitfarms, are taking a proactive approach to
                                reducing energy waste. Some clean energy sources, such as hydropower, generate
                                electricity at all times, regardless of whether or not it is being used. Many companies
                                will only utilize power when there's no other use for it. For example, several of
                                Bitfarms' Quebec farms only use excess energy and do not consume electricity during
                                "peak hours" for energy consumption, such as in the morning and in the evening after
                                traditional work hours.
